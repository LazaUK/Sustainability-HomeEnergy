# Sustainability - Measuring energy consumption at home
This is my contribution to the open source project, based on the original idea from Anurag Peshne and Chris Templeman to measure **energy consumption from home for the work-related activities**.

## Pre-requisites: 
For this tutorial, you would need the following hardware components:

- Computer with the Internet connectivity and pre-installed Python 3.x;
- Azure subscription to provision backend cloud resources

## Step 0 - Setup
1. Download content of this repo;
2. Install python-kasa library, either by using pip command as shown below or manually as described on [PyPi] (https://pypi.org/project/python-kasa):
```
